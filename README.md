## Tasks Performed in the Program
1. Creating a File : The createFile() method is used to create a new text file named "FileCreate.txt". The File class is used to check if the file already exists or if  a new file needs to be   created. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.If the file already exists, it notifies the user.

2. Writing Data to a File :
   The writeFile() method writes text data into the file using the FileWriter class. It opens the file and writes the given text into it.After writing, it closes the file to save the changes.

3. Reading Data from a File :
   The readFile() method reads the content of the file using the Scanner class.It opens the file and reads its contents line by line.The content is displayed in the console.

4. Modifying the File :
   The modifyFile() method appends new text to the existing file using the FileWriter class in append mode.The second argument true in FileWriter enables appending to the file instead of 
   overwriting. It updates the file by adding new content

5. Reading the File Again :
  After modification, the program calls readFile() again to display the updated content.


                      Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is an code editor for writing and executing Java programs that used in file handling code.
